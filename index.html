    <There style="font-size:  x-large;"  class="kl">There are significant inequalities in access to secondary education as far as income, gender, social group and geography are concerned. The capacity of the secondary schooling system needs to be significantly expanded across India.For instance, only 16% of India’s education budget is spent on secondary education compared to 62% for primary education (K. Biswal, 2011; Secondary education in India: Development policies, programmes and challenges). The gross enrolment rate (GER) for combined secondary and senior secondary stages (Classes IX–XII) was nearly 50% in 2009-10. Besides, not a single Indian University figures in the top 200 of the QS World University rankings 2013.</p>

        <p class="kl" style="font-size:  x-large;">The Education and Sports for All (ESA) initiative was launched in 2010 with the objective of providing access to quality education in India. Through a partnership with several NGOs, Reliance Foundation and Mumbai Indians have positively impacted the lives of 200,000 of underprivileged children during the last few years.Mrs. Nita Ambani spearheads the ESA initiative. The Mumbai Indians team is actively engaged in the initiative and has exhibited their ardent support for the cause. The ESA programme supports various initiatives that work with underprivileged children, promote girl-child education and impart life skills to the differently abled.
